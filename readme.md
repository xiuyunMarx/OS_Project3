# File system Project
## introduction 
This is a simple toy project of file system, first I implemented a simulated disk system, and build a file system and its server based on it.

Run 
```
make
```
to compile the project.

## How to use
Inside the ./fs directory, run 
```
./FS
```
to start server in default configurations , and
```
./FC
```
to start a client. The server and client will listen and connect to default port.
