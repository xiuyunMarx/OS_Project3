# File system Project
## introduction 
This is a simple toy project of file system, first I implemented a simulated disk system, and build a file system and its server based on it.

Run 
```
make
```
to compile the project.

## Test
Run 
```
make test
```
in the root directory, Note that **YOU MUST SWITCH TO 'ForTest' BRANCH** before testing.
## How to use
Inside the ./fs directory, run 
```
./FS
```
to start server in default configurations , and
```
./FC
```
to start a client. The server and client will listen and connect to default port.

The detailed usage can be found in report.pdf
